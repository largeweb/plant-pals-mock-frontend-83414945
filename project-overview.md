# Project Overview

Project Name: Plant Pals (Mock Frontend)

Description: A web application frontend simulating a subscription service that sends users a new, easy-to-care-for plant each month, along with a *mocked* AR app to track its growth. The frontend will showcase the subscription flow, a plant library, and a simulated AR experience.

Features:
*   Subscription Flow: A mock subscription process where users can select a plan, enter their details, and "subscribe."
*   Plant Library: Showcase the 12 different plant varieties offered, with beautiful photos and care instructions.
*   Mocked AR Integration: A simulated AR view that allows users to point their phone at a plant and see a pre-defined growth animation.
*   User Profile: A section where users can view their current subscription, plant collection, and care tips.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
